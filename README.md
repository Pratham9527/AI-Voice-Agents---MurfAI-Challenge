🎙️ 10 Days of AI Voice Agents Challenge (Murf AI)

This repository tracks my progress through the Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge 2025. The goal is to build a fully functional, low-latency, conversational AI agent using modern tools and the Murf Falcon TTS API over 10 days.

⚡ Core Technology Stack

The entire project is built on a real-time, low-latency stack:

TTS (Voice): Murf Falcon

STT (Ears): Deepgram

LLM (Brain): Google Gemini Flash

Orchestration: LiveKit Agents (Python)
