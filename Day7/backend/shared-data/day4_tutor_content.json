There are two main types: 'for loops' which repeat a specific number of times, and 'while loops' which repeat as long as a condition is true. For example, a for loop can print numbers 1 to 10, while a while loop can keep asking for input until the user enters 'quit'.",

Functions help organize code, avoid repetition, and make programs easier to understand. For example, a 'calculate_area(width, height)' function could multiply width by height and return the result.",

For example, 'if age >= 18' checks if someone is an adult, and you can run different code for adults vs. minors. You can chain multiple conditions using 'elif' (else if) and provide a fallback with 'else'.",
